0.3.0.1
-------
<https://github.com/mstksg/ghcjs-websockets/releases/tag/v0.3.0.1>

*   Fixed the "other-modules" cabal file field to include non-exported but
    important modules.

0.3.0.0
-------
<https://github.com/mstksg/ghcjs-websockets/releases/tag/v0.3.0.0>

*   First official release.  API more or less stabilized.  Library is more or
    less stable, but there are still some extra aspects of the javascript
    websockets API to hook onto for more power/information, and some
    javascript errors to be handled on edge cases.
